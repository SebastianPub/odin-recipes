    <img src="../img/latte-small.jpg">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shot of espresso (or 1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee)</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder or cinnamon for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew a shot of espresso using an espresso machine or make
             a strong cup of coffee using your preferred method.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until
             it starts to steam. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Using a whisk or a milk frother, froth the milk until it
             becomes thick and foamy. This can also be done by shaking
            the milk vigorously in a sealed jar for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot espresso or coffee into a mug.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the frothed milk into the mug, holding back the
             foam with a spoon to allow more milk to enter. Once the milk
              is poured, spoon the foam on top.</li>
        <li>If desired, sprinkle cocoa powder or cinnamon on top for extra
             flavor and decoration.</li>
        <li>Stir in sugar if you prefer a sweetened latte.</li>
        <li>Your latte is now ready to enjoy! ;)</li>
    </ol>
