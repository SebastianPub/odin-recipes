    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of fresh strawberries, washed and hulled</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of powdered sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the fresh strawberries into thin slices and set aside a few
            slices for garnish.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and 
            vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer or whisk, whip the cream mixture until it 
            reaches stiff peaks. This will take a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Take half of the sliced strawberries and gently fold them into the 
            whipped cream, reserving the remaining half for serving.</li>
        <li>Once the strawberries are incorporated into the cream, you can 
            either serve the mixture immediately or refrigerate it for a while 
            to chill and set.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the strawberry and cream mixture into serving bowls 
            or glasses.</li>
        <li>Top each serving with the reserved sliced strawberries.</li>
        <li>If desired, garnish with fresh mint leaves for an extra touch of 
            freshness and color.</li>
        <li>Your delicious strawberry and cream dessert is now ready to be enjoyed!</li>
