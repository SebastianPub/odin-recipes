    <li>1 pizza crust (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>

<h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
Prepare your desired toppings by slicing them thinly or chopping them into small pieces.
Dust a clean surface with cornmeal or flour, then roll out your pizza crust to your desired thickness and shape.
Transfer the crust to a pizza pan or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges.
Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
Add your desired toppings on top of the cheese.
Sprinkle the grated parmesan cheese over the toppings.
Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>Enjoy your homemade pizza! ;)</strong></h3>
